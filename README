What is Bucket?
  Bucket is (supposedly) a compiled, object oriented programming language with
  advanced compile time code execution and partial evaluation. It is also the
  name of this software project, which is a Bucket compiler written in C++17
  and using the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

Why is it called Bucket?
  Watch a bad TV show called Terra Nova and that will answer your question.

Does this code work?
  No. It should be complete by the time Q > 1 is achieved in a fusion reactor.

How can I contact you if I have any further questions?
  I am available on telegram as @clairehansel
