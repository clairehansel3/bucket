*********************************************************************************
*   2020, west of Los Angeles. A doomed side project by a nerdy gay kid. More   *
*      than a compiler, less than an interpreter, it's trying to grow into      *
*              something usable before the world ends. Send help.               *
*                                                                               *

What is Bucket?
  Bucket is (supposedly) a compiled, object oriented programming language with
  advanced features for compile time code execution and partial evaluation. It
  can also refer to the Bucket compiler, which is an interpreter/LLVM frontend
  written in C++17.

What's the current status of Bucket?
  Currently the compiler is able to compile simple programs which include
  variable assignment, basic math, loops, conditionals, and function calls, but
  not strings, pointers, user defined classes, or any standard library features.
  The compile time object model isn't currently set up.

Why is it called Bucket?
  Watch a bad TV show called Terra Nova and that will answer your question.

How can I contact you if I have further questions?
