Implement compile time hashing for string2Keyword and string2Symbol in token.cxx
to prevent exit time destructors.

Make tokens hold a reference to a SourceFile object, and make abstract syntax
tree nodes hold tokens. This is so better highlighting can be done.

Change 'assert' to 'BUCKET_ASSERT' which raises an exception. Similary change
boost polymorphic_pointer_downcast to something that raises an exception.

Change how the ast works at the top level: re-introduce the 'module' node.

Make TreeTransform obsolete by making changes to the lexer
